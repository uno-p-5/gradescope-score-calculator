# gradescope-score-calculator
calculates how many you passed/failed, useful for knowing how many points you missed before grades get released (so u dont have to do it urself)

idk if this has issues I tested it like once, putting this on github took longer than actually writing the script so yeah just make an issue if it doesnt work lol

## How to use

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) ([Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) and then come back and click [this](https://github.com/uno-p-5/gradescope-score-calculator/raw/refs/heads/main/epicgamer.user.js) (or just paste userscript.user.js contents into a new tampermonkey script)
